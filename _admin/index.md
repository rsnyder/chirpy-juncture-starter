# Welcome to the Admin Documentation

This area brings together two things:

* The official documentation for the Chirpy theme
* Additional guides explaining how to use the Juncture extensions built on top of Chirpy

If you are creating or editing content for this site, this is where you should start.

## What This Covers

Chirpy provides the foundation: how to create posts, manage front matter, insert images, embed media, configure previews, and control layout. If you are new to the theme, begin with:

* **[Getting Started](getting-started)** 
* **[Writing a New Post](write-a-new-post)** 
* **[Text and Typography](text-and-typography)** 
* **[Customize the Favicon](customize-the-favicon)** 

These documents explain the core conventions that everything else builds on.

The Juncture documentation then shows you how to go beyond standard posts — adding interactive image viewers, maps, comparisons, and other embedded components using simple Markdown and Liquid include tags.

* **[Juncture Overview](juncture-overview)** 
* **[Image Viewer](juncture-image-viewer)** 
* **[Map Viewer](juncture-map-viewer)** 
* **[Image Compare Viewer](juncture-image-compare-viewer)** 
* **[YouTube Viewer](juncture-youtube-viewer)** 

A complete list of documents is found in the **[Guides](#guides)** section below.

## Who This Is For

Most content authors do **not** need to understand HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

If you are comfortable writing basic Markdown and copying small snippets of example code, you have all the technical background required.

The goal of these extensions is to let you create rich, visual essays without needing to think about implementation details.

## How to Use This Documentation

1. Start with the Chirpy basics if you haven’t already.
2. Browse the Juncture component guides.
3. Copy the provided examples into your own post.
4. Modify the parameters (image paths, captions, IDs, etc.) to fit your content.

If something doesn’t work, it is usually one of three issues:

* A file path is incorrect
* A required front matter setting is missing
* A Liquid tag was copied with a small typo

The examples in these docs are meant to be directly reusable.

## A Practical Approach

Think of Chirpy as the publishing engine.
Think of Juncture as a set of specialized tools you can plug into that engine.

You don’t need to understand how those tools are built — only how to use them correctly.

This section exists to make that straightforward.
